  <div class="container about-container">
    <p>Hi! My name is Samson Ruiyang Sun, a recent graduate with great passion in web and app design. By learning from friends and online, I have made progress in programing skills. By day, I work at Oracle as a web develop intern and continually learn new and cool staff.</p>
    <p>I like graphic design and sketching. Some of my previous work are shown in my little <a href="#!/gallery">Art Gallery</a>. I'm also enthusiastic about body-building and keep a regular work-out schedule for almost 4 years.</p>

      <h3>About This Website</h3>
      <p>This website was originally built using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Bootstrap. The current version is built on AngularJS with UI Bootstrap and css animation. I like to apply different technologies to my website to make it cool.</p>
